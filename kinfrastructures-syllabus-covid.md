# Course Description
Infrastructure is all around us, rarely remarked upon. Indeed, the latent state of infrastructure is part of what marks it as such; as Susan Leigh Starr has noted, infrastructure studies involves the examination of "boring things."

 
This class will explore the emerging nexus of critical infrastructure studies and critical university studies, focusing on the infrastructure of scholarly knowledge. From our libraries to our journals to our conferences to our operating systems to our use of social media, scholars communicate through an entanglement of corporate and commercial interests. Beyond the obviously problematic commercial infrastructures built by predatory publishers and corporate conglomerates such as Elsevier, scholars routinely depend on for-profit publication venues and commercial journals to disseminate their work.

As a set of alternatives to the commercialized infrastructure of knowledge dissemination in the academy, the course will consider open access publication models, free software development, and university press publishing. Even as we explore such alternatives, we will critique them, considering the ways that such alternatives themselves depend upon commercial technical stacks, and considering whether these alternatives are equally available and accessible across the globe.

 
Topics to be explored include: introductions to critical infrastructure studies and critical university studies; the environmental impact of the cloud; the free software movement; academic publishing models; constructing open platforms. Students in the class will explore publishing platforms collaboratively created by CUNY and other partners, including the CUNY Academic Commons and Manifold, as well as others such as Humanities Commons and Zotero. The goal of the class, in the end, is to ask students to consider how and where their own scholarly knowledge is distributed, and by whom and under what terms.

# Learning Objectives

* Explore and become familiar with the fields of critical infrastructure studies, digital humanities, and critical university studies

* Become more aware of knowledge systems and infrastructures we participate in

* Consider the materiality of technical infrastructure and its entanglements in social, political, and interpersonal contexts

* Make a collective intervention into the knowledge infrastructure of The Graduate Center and/or CUNY

* Devote time and space to reading, thinking, and writing

# Student Disability Services
It is Graduate Center and CUNY policy to provide appropriate accommodations to students with disabilities. Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this class is advised to speak directly to the manager of [Student Disability Services](http://cuny.is/disabilityservices), located in Student Affairs, room 7301, or call 212-817-7400 as early in the semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential.

# Requirements and Structure
## Weekly Reading and Discussion:
Students should complete all weekly readings in advance of the class meeting and should take an active part in class discussions.

## Assignments
## Blog Posts and Class Discussions
Each week, one student will write a response to the assigned readings, to be posted by Tuesday morning the day before the class in which those readings will be discussed. These posts should offer a brief 1-2 paragraph response to the course texts and then should provide a set of 4-7 questions for group discussion. The post may also provide links to relevant related readings and resources. In class that day, that student will frame and initiate our discussion in class that week.

Other assignments should be posted to the blog as suggested below. Generally, we should try to use our course blog as a way to share information with each other and anyone else following the course from afar. Students who prefer to post privately may use our agreed-upon password to protect their posts.

### Personal Narrative
Write a short (~500 word) blog post about some aspect of your personal knowledge infrastructure. You might think about how you keep track of citations, how you store/annotate academic articles, how you access academic texts, what systems you use to write. In your post, do some work to extend your knowledge of the infrastructure surrounding your topic/tool/platform and reflect a bit on your choices.

### Ethnography Project
Choose one aspect of a knowledge infrastructure and perform a short (~500-1000 words) ethnography of it. This assignment will be expanded soon with guides and examples that will help you conduct an online ethnography. 

### Collective Intervention in GC/CUNY Knowledge Infrastructures (Final Project)
Through class discussions, we will come to a consensus on an intervention that we will collectively make into the knowledge infrastructures at the GC or in CUNY.

Students should complete a 500-word reflection on the collective intervention, to be posted on the course blog, due May 20.

# Differential Credit Requirements:
* Audit/2 credits: all assignments except Personal Narrative and Ethnography Project
* 4 credits: All assignments

# Grading
Regular participation in our class discussions and online spaces is essential. 
* Attendance and Participation (25%)
* Blog posts (20%)
* Personal Narrative (15%)

# POINTS OF DEPARTURE
## 1/29 - Introductions
*What is "infrastructure"? What is knowledge? What systems do we use ourselves, and what systems do those systems depend on? What issues are most important to us to explore this semester, and how can we together design a course that provides a meaningful learning experience for all of us? Reading through the syllabus as a whole, what changes would you like to make in this syllabus?*
